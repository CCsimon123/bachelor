# Code for an artificial neural network

1. The file artificial_neural_network.py file contains the neural network.
2. It uses the help files in the folder help_funs.
3. The data file contains all data to train and validate the network.
4. The saved_models folder contains trained models.

The code is ready to run as it is, but you can change the input data if you want to train on another dataset.

You can also change the hyperparameters  to get a different result.

Change the flags that are self explanatory to get the desired behaviour.
